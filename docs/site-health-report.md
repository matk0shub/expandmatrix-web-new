# Site Health Verification

## Overview
This report captures the checks run on the project to confirm the web application builds successfully and that key assets, such as the self-hosted Lato font family, are available.

## Checks Performed
- `npm run lint` to ensure the codebase passes ESLint without errors.
- `npm run build` to produce a production build with Next.js and verify there are no runtime issues during compilation or static generation.

## Results
All checks completed successfully:
- Linting finished without reporting any issues.
- The production build compiled, generated static pages, and finalized optimizations without errors.

### Latest verification (2025-10-14 UTC)
- `npm run lint`
  - Completed without diagnostics, confirming project-wide code quality gates still pass.
- `npm run build`
  - Next.js 15.5.4 compiled in production mode, validated type safety, and produced prerendered output for all 11 static routes.
  - Reported first-load JavaScript of 239 kB for the localized landing page (`/[locale]`), keeping bundle sizes within expected bounds for good performance and SEO readiness.

## Notes
- Locally bundled Lato font files are present under `public/fonts`, ensuring the preferred typography works even without external font CDNs.
- Build artifacts list route-level bundle sizes, confirming the application is optimized and deployable.
